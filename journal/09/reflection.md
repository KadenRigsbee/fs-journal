# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    the issues and questions I have are usually simple to solve and I find myself better understanding the process thanks to all the help from my instructors. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    I once again received a humbling reminder just how easy it is to miss the simplest of errors and how blind we can sometimes be to them.
- What are you struggling with?
    locking in. I start one task then find myself distracted on the program and start branching into fields that in the grand scheme of things should either be saved for later or not worked on at all.
- What would you count as a victory?
    It's not exactly a victory, but I'd be remiss if I did not take a moment in this reflection to appreciate the generous level of assistance I have received from Mick. His efforts have not gone unnoticed and I struggle to put into words just how much I appreciate his help over the past few weeks.
