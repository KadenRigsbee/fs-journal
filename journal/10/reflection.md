# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Very little but hey you know what that's life baby we move 🫡😎
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    C#
    I find it both simple and complex in a way that makes it hard to tell whether or not I actually have a solid understanding of it.
- What are you struggling with?
    I had a lot of outside issues that negatively impacted my attendance. While I
    was able to attend remotely, I feel like I am missing key pieces of
    information from monday and tuesday's lectures specifically.
- What would you count as a victory?
    my car is fully repaired, I have food in my fridge, and I'm doing my best to
    grind out some code despite the late start so 👍
