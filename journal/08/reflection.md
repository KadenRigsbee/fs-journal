# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I forced myself to ask lots of questions. It overall proved to be a positive experience; I obtained more knowledge, my progress was expedited, and my stress was reduced.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    I learned some interesting tricks from mick while establishing the back end for my checkpoint. Things like utilizing some whack if statements within the service, calling another service from the service, as well as a fun fact that to objects that have equal values will return false when compared to each other. when you compare their values it returns true, but it considers the objects themselves (despite having the same values) different.
- What are you struggling with?
    staying awake. my mind and body are drained and caffeinated beverages are my salvation
- What would you count as a victory?
    All my postman tests passed so i've made a good head start on this project. Happy with the momentum I've got, now I just need to maintain it :D
